# Instructions

Command : ./cliCommand <theFile>

# Init Release:

Url Checker V0.1


# Scope

create a command-line tool in your chosen language.

# How It Works

Using the power of Linux's built in commands, such as, grep, curl and head we can request urls via command line interface. This information is then processed using the Head command along with some additional feautres.
We simply check the status code of each URL we requested and let the user know if there are any Broken ( 400 and 404 ) links are found.

# Optional Features Include:

1. Colored code.
2. option -v will return the current version information.
